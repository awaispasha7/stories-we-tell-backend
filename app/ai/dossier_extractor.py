Conversation:
{context}

Extract the following information (use "Unknown" if not mentioned). Always include all keys. If something is not present, use empty string for strings and [] for arrays.

STORY FRAME (Frame-first approach):
1. story_timeframe: When does the story take place?
2. story_location: Where does it take place?
3. story_world_type: Real/Invented-in-our-world/Invented-other-world
4. writer_connection_place_time: Connection to writer's time/place

CHARACTER (Subject):
5. subject_exists_real_world: boolean/unknown
6. subject_full_name: Character's name
7. subject_relationship_to_writer: Relationship to writer
8. subject_brief_description: Brief character description

STORY CRAFT:
9. problem_statement: What problem does the character face?
10. actions_taken: What actions does the character take?
11. outcome: What is the outcome?
12. likes_in_story: What does the writer like about this story?

TECHNICAL:
13. runtime: Estimated runtime (3-5 minutes)
14. title: Working title (if mentioned)
15. logline: Single-sentence premise (if implied)

CHARACTERS (array; include key even if empty):
- name, description, role (e.g., protagonist/mentor)

SCENES (array; include key even if empty):
- one_liner (short beat/scene summary)
- Optional: time_of_day, interior_exterior, tone

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format:
